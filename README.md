# Waitlist Checker
This is a basic Python script that can be used to check the status of the courses at SFU. During enrolment time go.sfu.ca is really heavy and it is difficult to check the course status agauin and again. But this automatic script keeps on updating every 2 hours and will show the status of your courses in the terminal. This script is using Selenium (It is a portable framework for testing web applications and can also be used for automating web browsers) for running automatically. Also, this script will notify you if your waitlist is clear or not.

## Usage
This script can be run using python waitlist_checker.py your_username_here your_password_here
